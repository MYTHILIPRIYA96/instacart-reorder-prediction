# Instacart-reorder-prediction
Deep learning-based reorder prediction using tabular features from Instacart orders dataset.
# Product Reorder Prediction using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a user will reorder a product based on their past order history and product information. We use a combination of feature engineering, resampling techniques to handle imbalanced data, and a fully connected feed-forward neural network (FFNN) to build a robust classification model.

Key components include:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering on large-scale order datasets.
User, product, and user-product aggregated features extraction.
Handling class imbalance using SMOTEENN (a hybrid over- and under-sampling method).
Training an improved FFNN model with batch normalization and dropout for regularization.
Model evaluation with precision-recall threshold tuning and multiple classification metrics.
Saving the trained model for future inference.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Instacart orders and includes:

Orders information (`orders.csv`)
Prior ordered products (`order_products__prior.csv`)
Training labels (`order_products__train.csv`)
Product metadata (`products.csv`, `aisles.csv`, `departments.csv`)

    '''

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Data Processing

 Run data_processing to load raw CSV files, merge datasets in chunks, and generate aggregated feature files (`final_features.csv`) and training labels (`train_labels.csv`).

### 2. Feature Engineering

 Execute feature_engineering to perform:
   Missing value imputation
   Categorical encoding (Label Encoding and Category Codes)
   Numerical feature scaling with StandardScaler

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation

Use train_model to:
Load processed features and labels
Perform train/validation/test split with stratification
Apply SMOTEENN resampling to balance the training set
Train an improved feed-forward neural network with callbacks (early stopping, learning rate reduction)
Evaluate model on the test set with optimized thresholding
Save the trained model as `ffnn_model.h5`

### 4. Inference and Prediction

Load ffnn_model.h5 in your application to predict reorder probabilities for new user-product pairs.
Use the same preprocessing pipeline to prepare input features before prediction.

## Evaluation Metrics

 Accuracy
 Precision
 Recall
 F1 Score
 ROC-AUC
 Confusion Matrix visualization


## Notes

 The dataset is large; processing is performed in chunks to manage memory efficiently.
 Threshold tuning is performed on precision-recall curve to maximize F1 score, suitable for imbalanced classification.
 The model architecture uses dropout and batch normalization to improve generalization.
